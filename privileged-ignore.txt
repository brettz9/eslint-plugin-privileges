# Would expect to be able to require this with `--ignore-path="privileged-ignore.txt"`
# However, the unignores at least do does not seem to work, but one
# can instead add these arguments:
# --ignore-pattern='!node_modules/**' --ignore-pattern='!bower_components/**' --ignore-pattern='!*.js'

# Haven't tried the following yet but double quotes might work in Windows and
# the escaping help it work in Unix (such escaping of `!` isn't needed in
# Unix for single quotes)
# --ignore-pattern="\!node_modules/**" --ignore-pattern="\!bower_components/**" --ignore-pattern="\!*.js"

!.*.js
!node_modules/**
!bower_components/**
